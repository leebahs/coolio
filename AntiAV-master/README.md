# How it works?
It goes through several procecess:
* Compressing few times
* Injecting junk code
* Reducing file size
* Creating external launcher (only `main.bat` can launch it)
* Obfuscating `main.bat` so only "experienced" user can see how is works

# Can I upload it to VirusTotal?
Sure, go ahead.
